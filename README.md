## Advanced Closed-Loop Email Analysis and Response System

### Overview

This project provides a scalable and advanced closed-loop email analysis and response system. It leverages AWS services for serverless processing, S3 for storage, SageMaker for machine learning, and OpenAI's GPT-4 for response generation. The system classifies emails, analyzes sentiment, generates responses, and automates tasks such as calendar event creation. It is designed for commercial use, integrating seamlessly with enterprise tools and ensuring compliance with security standards.

### Prerequisites

1. **AWS Account**: Access to AWS services (Lambda, S3, SQS, SageMaker, SES, IAM).
2. **Google Cloud Account**: For Google Calendar API (Optional, if calendar events are required).
3. **OpenAI API Key**: Access to OpenAI's GPT-4.
4. **Python 3.7+**: Python environment for local testing and deployment.
5. **AWS CLI**: Installed and configured with appropriate permissions.

### Project Structure

- `lambda_function.py`: Main Lambda function script for processing emails.
- `train.py`: Script for training the email classification model using SageMaker.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.
- `service_account.json`: Google Cloud service account credentials (not included, to be generated).
- `config.json`: Configuration file for various settings (AWS, API keys, etc.).

### Setup Instructions

### Step 1: AWS Setup

1. **Create S3 Bucket**:
    - Create an S3 bucket for storing email contents and processed data.
2. **Create SQS Queue**:
    - Create an SQS queue for email message processing.
3. **Set Up IAM Roles**:
    - Create an IAM role with permissions for Lambda, S3, SQS, SES, and SageMaker.
    - Attach the necessary policies to the role.
4. **Deploy Lambda Functions**:
    - Upload `lambda_function.py` to AWS Lambda.
    - Set the Lambda function's execution role to the IAM role created.
5. **Configure SES**:
    - Set up an SES email receiving rule to trigger the Lambda function.
    - Verify email addresses or domains in SES for sending emails.

### Step 2: Google Cloud Setup (Optional)

1. **Enable Google Calendar API**:
    - Enable the Calendar API in the Google Cloud Console.
2. **Create Service Account**:
    - Create a service account with the required permissions.
    - Download the JSON key file (`service_account.json`).

### Step 3: OpenAI Setup

1. **API Key**:
    - Obtain an API key from OpenAI and add it to `config.json`.

### Step 4: Local Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    
    ```bash
    bashCopy code
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/closed-loop-email-system.git
    cd closed-loop-email-system
    ```
    
2. **Install Dependencies**:
    
    ```bash
    bashCopy code
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
3. **Configure `config.json`**:
    - Add AWS, Google Cloud, and OpenAI credentials and settings.

### Step 5: Model Training

1. **Upload Training Data to S3**:
    - Prepare your email classification dataset and upload it to the S3 bucket.
2. **Train the Model**:
    - Run the `train.py` script on SageMaker to train your classification model.
3. **Deploy the Model**:
    - Deploy the trained model using SageMaker.

### Running the System

1. **Email Ingestion**:
    - Incoming emails are ingested via SES and forwarded to the Lambda function.
2. **Email Classification and Sentiment Analysis**:
    - The Lambda function processes the email, classifies it using the deployed model, and performs sentiment analysis.
3. **Response Generation**:
    - Based on the classification and sentiment, a response is generated using OpenAI GPT-4.
4. **Task Automation**:
    - For specific email categories (e.g., scheduling), the system creates calendar events using the Google Calendar API.
5. **Sending Responses**:
    - The system sends the generated responses via SES and logs the interactions.

### Monitoring and Logging

- **CloudWatch**:
    - All logs and metrics are available in AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and troubleshooting.

### Security and Compliance

- **Encryption**:
    - Ensure data is encrypted at rest (S3) and in transit.
- **Access Control**:
    - Use IAM roles and policies to restrict access to resources.
- **Compliance**:
    - Regularly review and ensure compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR and CCPA.
